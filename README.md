# Personality and Drug Consumption

For this project "Personality and Drug Consumption", my goal was to predict drug consumption based on personality traits. To achieve this, I utilized supervised machine learning algorithms for binary classification. I first conducted a detailed exploratory data analysis to get an understanding of the dataset's characteristics. I then employed various methodologies, including a decision tree classifier, a random forest classifier, logistic regression, and deep learning. To ensure optimal performance, I incorporated hyper-parameter fine-tuning techniques like grid search and cross-validation. Finally, I performed a thorough model evaluation by interpreting different metrics of the testing results, such as confusion matrix and recall scores. 

Although none of the models proved to be sufficiently predictive, this experience allowed me to gain knowledge about the Machine Learning workflow and provided me with the necessary tools for future projects.
